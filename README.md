# üìö LLM Book Summaries

Welcome to my collection of Large Language Model (LLM) book summaries! This repository serves as a knowledge-sharing hub where I document insights from various books I read about LLMs, AI, and related technologies.

## üìñ Current Summaries

### [LLMOps: Operationalizing Large Language Models](LLMOps.md)
